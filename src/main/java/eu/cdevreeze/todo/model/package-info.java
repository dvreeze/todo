/**
 * Domain as immutable data classes, using immutable Guava collections for collection-valued data.
 * <p>
 * These classes are immutable record classes, so they have well-defined value equality.
 * Also, with these data classes what you see is what you get: no lazy loading, no proxying, and no
 * hidden state.
 * <p>
 * These immutable data classes help make the abstract service API completely technology-agnostic,
 * which also enhanced testability of higher layers than the service layer.
