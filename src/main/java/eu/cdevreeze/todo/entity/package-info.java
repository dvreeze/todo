/**
 * Domain as JPA entity classes. These entity classes are great as Java representations
 * of database data, and can easily be synchronized with the database (in both directions).
 * <p>
 * Yet they are very poor data transfer objects. After all, they are highly mutable, are often
 * proxied (as instances of generated proxy subclasses), and looking at entities in isolation
 * does not tell us to what extent associations have been loaded. Hence, the existence of a
 * separate immutable model that represents exactly the same domain.
 * <p>
 * Note that associations between entities have been made lazy in this model. See
 * <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/7.0/introduction/html_single/Hibernate_Introduction.html#many-to-one">many-to-one</a>.
 * Note that one-to-many and many-to-many associations are already lazy by default in JPA.
 * It is only for one-to-one and many-to-one associations that we override the default (of eager fetching).
 * In other words, this practice embraces the flexibility of the relational model, joining tables on an ad-hoc basis.
