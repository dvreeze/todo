/**
 * Service layer, as technology-agnostic Java interfaces, implemented by concrete Java classes
 * in a sub-package.
 * <p>
 * The concrete implementation classes take care of transaction management, database access
 * (either directly or indirectly), etc.
 * <p>
 * The service API in this package is completely technology-agnostic, and can easily be mocked in
 * unit tests. That is, the service interfaces are purely abstract, and the exchanged data objects
 * are model objects as immutable Java records. The latter objects are also technology-agnostic, in
 * contrast to JPA entities.
 * <p>
 * Finally, note that from an API point of view, the functions in the service interfaces are pure
 * functions, taking immutable data arguments and returning immutable data objects as well. Of course,
 * the service implementations do have side effects, but as far as the service API is concerned those
 * are implementation details.
